.SYNOPSIS
Enabling certificate signing of PowerShell serialization payloads.

.DESCRIPTION
This script creates an override that enables certificate signing of PowerShell serialization payloads.

.OUTPUT
Exchange uses its internal Auth Certificate to cryptographically sign the serialized data before transmission. On the receiving end, the signature is verified to ensure the payload hasn't been altered. This mechanism adds integrity validation to the serialization process, making it significantly harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in EMS communications.

.NOTES
Optionally modify the override Name and Reason, as desired.
