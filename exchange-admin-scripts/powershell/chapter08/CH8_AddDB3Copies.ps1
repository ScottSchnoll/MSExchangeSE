.SYNOPSIS
This script is part 3 of a 4-part series of scripts that create a 4-member DAG extended across two sites.

.DESCRIPTION
This script creates HA copies of DB3 on EX2 and EX4, and a 3-day lagged copy on EX1 that is seeded from EX2. It also suspends the copy of DB3 on EX1 from activation.

.OUTPUT
HA copies of DB3 are created on EX2 and EX4, and a lagged copy with a 3-day lag is created on EX1 by seeding it from EX2. Database copy DB3\EX1 is suspended for activation.

.NOTES
When using this script, be sure you use your database and server names, and choose the lagged copy settings that are appropriate for your organization.
