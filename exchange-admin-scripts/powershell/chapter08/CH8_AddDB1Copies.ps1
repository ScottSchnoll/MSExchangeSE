.SYNOPSIS
This script is part 1 of a 4-part series of scripts that create a 4-member DAG extended across two sites.

.DESCRIPTION
This script creates HA copies of DB1 on EX2 and EX4, and a 3-day lagged copy on EX3 that is seeded from EX4. It also suspends the copy of DB1 on EX3 from activation.

.OUTPUT
HA copies of DB1 are created on EX2 and EX4, and a lagged copy with a 3-day lag is created on EX3 by seeding it from EX4. Database copy DB1\EX3 is suspended for activation.

.NOTES
When using this script, be sure you use your database and server names, and choose the lagged copy settings that are appropriate for your organization.
